<h2 align="left">ℹ️ About</h2>

This documentation describes the specifications and usage of the GYMBAR, GYMBAR SALES app. These two applications are used to manage the partitions that provide food for the exercisers in each gym branch.




## ❗️ Problem
There are partitions in each of the gymnasiums to sell the food items for the exercisers and guests, and the owner of these partitions finds it difficult to manage each of them, as each branch contains different customers, and there are many branches and then many partitions, so it became difficult to manage all these partitions together using the old traditional methods.




## 💡 My Proposal
Building a program to solve the management problem, the program can manage each branch separately and show results on a daily and organized basis, It is divided into two applications and a Tablet/iPad app for selling and an iPhone/Android app for the managers to follow the buying and selling processes and follow the progress.
